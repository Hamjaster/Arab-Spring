      In world history, there have been many
      revolutions in which people stood against
      the monarchy and ended them. Arab
      revolution or Arab Spring of 2011 is
      also one of these. It consisted of a
      series of anti-dictatorship protesting
      and uprisings in Tunisia, Syria, Egypt,
      Libya, Jordan, Yemen, Oman, and etc.

        It was the time of 2010. Tunisia (a country located in the northernmost of the African continent) was ruled by
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zine_El_Abidine_Ben_Ali" class="text-decoration-none">Zine El Abidine Ben Ali</a>  for a long period of 23 years with uttering and disappointing results, causing
        unemployment and disgrace. In December 2010, a 26-year-old local vendor in Tunisia was selling fruits when some
        officials came and harassed him because he didn’t had a license. That fruit seller, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Bouazizi" class="text-decoration-none">Muhammad Bouaziz</a> , stood
        outside the local government office and set himself on fire.
        National Hero and a martyr for the whole country and a revolution arose in Tunisia. People came on the roads and
        markets, they protested against the corrupt dictatorship with flags and cell phones in their hands. This
        movement gripped the whole country and within a small period of 7 days, Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, was forced to
        <img src="vendor.jfif" alt="buazizi" width="204px" class=" me-2 my-2 float-start"> He died due to acute injuries. He
        emerged as
        go into exile in Saudia Arabia. His monarchy was fallen in January 2011. But! This was just the beginning. This
        revolution continued and spread across other Arabian countries, thus creating a series of anti-government
        protests, uprisings, and armed rebellions in Egypt, Algeria, Syria, Yemen, Oman, and other countries.

        emerged as
        This revolution gulped Egypt in the same way and their people protested against <a href="" class="text-decoration-none">Hosni Mubarak</a> , who had ruled
        Egypt for 30 years. Pro-democracy protesters, through Facebook and Twitter, spread the message to bring his
        regime down. As a result, a large-scale civil war in the country. Clashes arose between police and protestors.
        Lack of political freedom, high unemployment, corruption, inflation, and other socio-economic disabilities
        further enhanced the regime change movement. On January 11, 2011; Hosni Mubarak was forced to step down and
        <img src="morsi.jpg" alt="" width="124px" class=" me-2 my-2 float-start"> He died due to acute injuries. He
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_Brotherhood" class="text-decoration-none">Muslim Brotherhood</a>  ( Sunni Islamist Organization ) took power in Egypt. Elected Mohammed Morsi was made
        president which was then overthrown by the army. He was jailed and given a death sentence. The power of the
        regime change movement can be imagined by the fact that within the period of 18 days, Mubarak was overthrown
        into an elected democratic leader.

        Anti-government protests started began in Libya in Feb 2011. At that time Libya was ruled by a Libyan colonel
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_Brotherhood" class="text-decoration-none">Muammar Gaddafi</a>  for a period of about 42 years. The protester has spread to Tripoli (capital of Libya). The
        rising violence between the local public and the officials also caused many Libyan diplomats to resign but there
        seemed no chance for the resignation of that dictator (Gaddafi). In late August, anti-Gaddafi fighters captured
        Tripoli to scatter his long rule. Muammar Gadaffi was captured and very disgracefully killed. After his death,
        civil war began in Libya which is still continuing.

        Yemen was being ruled for 20 years by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Abdullah_Saleh" class="text-decoration-none">Ali Abdullah Saleh</a> . During the Arab Spring protests began in Yemen against
        Saleh hoping for stability in the country and an ending to corruption and poverty. This public unrest resulted
        in an assassination attempt on 3 June of Saleh, in which he was injured badly. He was evacuated to Saudi Arabia
        for treatment and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdrabbuh_Mansur_Hadi" class="text-decoration-none"> Mansur Hadi</a> took power as president. This president was supported by Saudis. By 2014, A Shia
        Muslim party named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houthi_movement " class="text-decoration-none">Houthis</a>  arose against the government. It joined hands with its former enemy Saleh and
        rebelled against the replacement government of Hadi, thus starting the Yemeni Civil War including the
        Saudi-Arabian and Iranian intervention in Yemen. Later Ali Abdullah Saleh was killed by the Houthis.

        In the aftermath, a wave of disturbance and a civil war began in most of the countries affected by the Arab
        Spring, which is termed as Arab Winter or Islamist Winter. Regional instability, economic decline, and religious
        wars between Suni and Shia Muslims started, particularly in Syria and Libya. However, some countries like Egypt
        and Tunisia were quite successful in this regard. Yemen is still suffering from a civil war, in which both
        Saudi-Arabian and Iranian interventions are common, and is now referred to as the worst humanitarian disaster.
